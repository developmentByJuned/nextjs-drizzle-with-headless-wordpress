```

## 🌍 Configuration
Before running the project, make sure to configure your database connection. Update the database configuration in your .env file:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/wordpress_db

Replace username, password, and wordpress_db with your MySQL credentials and the name of your WordPress database.

## ⚙️ Running Migrations

## 💡 Best Practices
Always back up your database before running migrations.
Review migration scripts before applying them to ensure they meet your requirements.
